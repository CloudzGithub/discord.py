# discord.py
This is a terminal-based Python discord bot. Once you enter the token, the bot will be online. This only has basic commands and it's default syntax is "s!".

Commands
s!help
s!hi
s!info
s!ping
s!serverinfo

In order to edit the commands or it's syntax, go into each command and change the command. To add more commands, follow the pattern in previous commands.

The .exe was packaged using pyinstaller. This means that it may be detected as a virus, so I will include the VirusTotal scan below.
